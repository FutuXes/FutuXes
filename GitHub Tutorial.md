GitHub Notes v 1.0

GitHub at its heart is essentially a project management tool. It is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. 
GitHub essentials: repositories, branches, commits and pull requests. 

Tutorial: create a Hello World repository and learn GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.

TUTORIAL: HELLO WORLD

A repository is used to organize a single project. They can contain folders, files, images, videos, spreadsheets and datasets. 
It is recommended that a README file is created and included, which contains information on your project. Another option to consider 
including is a license file. 

To create a new repository, name it, provide a short description and even intialize one with a README file. To do so, click the "+" 
icon in the top-right corner. 

Branching allows for version control; working on different versions of a repository at the one time. By default, the definitive 
branch is called the "master branch." New branches can be used to experiment and make edits before committing them to the master 
branch, or you can "pull" other branches in.

To create a new branch, select branch: master. Save changes by pressing "Commit changes." Consider adding a commit message so 
other contributors can understand why a particular change was made. 

This is the real power of GitHub. Click pull request tab (top-left), review changes (additions/deletions), click "Create pull 
request" providing a brief description of the changes. Press "Merge pull request" to accept changes from new branch into master
and click "Confirm merge", before clicking "Delete branch," since it has been merged into the master (retaining a copy of it now 
becomes redundant).
