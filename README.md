For those who are unaware, GitHub is essentially a project management tool. It is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It allows anyone to create, share and collaboratively work on a "repository." Repositories are used in GitHub to organize a single project. They can contain folders, files, images, videos, spreadsheets and datasets. GitHub's essential features include: repositories, branches, commits and pull requests.
