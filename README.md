# FutuXes
This is the first and official public FutuXes repository created on GitHub. FutuXes is a peer-to-peer, cryptocurrency banking platform created on top of the Ethereum blockchain using smart-contracts. 

For those who are unaware, GitHub is essentially a project management tool. It is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It allows anyone to create, share and collaboratively work on a "repository." Repositories are used in GitHub to organize a single project. They can contain folders, files, images, videos, spreadsheets and datasets. GitHub's essential features include: repositories, branches, commits and pull requests. 

Please be aware that this is currently an open-source respository, therefore it is PUBLIC. As such, anyone can view it, create branches and submit pull requests. Therefore, please me mindful of both your comments are well as the material you choose to share during collaboration.
